setup: true
#WhiteListed IPs:
#INFO: 1. To enable all hostnames, insert *. prefix before the whitelisted IP, e.g. *.yourserver.com will allow players connecting with
#         abc.yourserver.com, xyz.yourserver.com..., (useful for servers with AntiDDoS service).
#      2. To apply whitelisted IP without hostnames, insert only the IP without any prefix, e.g. yourserver.com will allow only players
#         connecting with yourserver.com.
#      3. If your server has dynamic IP, use {ip} placeholder as the server's IP (useful for dynamic IP servers).
#      4. To allow not case-sensitive hostname comparing for the current IP, insert "[NOT_CASE_SENSITIVE]" or "[CASE_SENSITIVE]"
#         (for case-sensitive comparing) right before the IP as shown in example whitelisted IPs list. If not inserted, the default
#         setting is case-sensitive.
#NOTE: You don't need to write ports there. IPWhiteList will automatically obtain port where is BungeeCord server hosted on.
#      However, if you write port there, BungeeCord port will be overridden by specified port.
