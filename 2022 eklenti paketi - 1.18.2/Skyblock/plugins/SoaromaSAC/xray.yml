# The second ROW of numbers is the 'OTHER' amount of blocks needed to mine for the first row of numbers to be exceeded to flag
# The third ROW of numbers is the Y axis the block has to be mined from, so for example if the number is 30, whatever is below the Y axis of 30
# Will be added to a list internally and be checked for
